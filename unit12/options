I am going to a table/ and a graph that will allow me to compare different options. 

I will need to find a way to access the options data
Then I will need to be able to calculate it (I also still don't know exactly what I want)
I need to find a visually aesthetic way to present the information. 

I will need to lean how to present the data so I'll need to find a good way to do that.
