Data Ethics
I think data ethics are very important to consider, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. AI bots could soon make decisions that positively (or negatively) affect people’s lives based on data that they have collected. Although they aren’t supposed to be biased, artificial intelligence often is and if it receives certain data, the data could skew its viewpoint. Companies should make sure that the data they are collecting is known and acknowledged by the user, and that means making sure the users know exactly what is being collected instead of just giving them a thousand-page terms & conditions document to read knowing well that no one on Earth is going to read it. Companies should prioritize data ethics to show the public that they are trustworthy and credible.
