## 1. What did you build?

    I was interested in analyzing a large quantity of stock data very quickly, so I built a program that uses the Polygon API to track stock prices. Using the program, I can quickly see how many days a stock went up, or went down over a certain time period. If you want to look closely, you can also see the change from each day. 

## 2. What did you learn?

    With the help of ChatGPT, I started to learn how to use python. I learned about the Polygon API, which will be useful in the future if I try and continue improving this project, or making another project similar to this one that uses financial data. 

## 3. How can we try it? 

    Make a copy of the folder. You should probably create your own account with Polygon, and if you do so make sure you change the API key in client.py to your own. Then you simply run the program, and if you would like you can change the ticker and/or data range.
